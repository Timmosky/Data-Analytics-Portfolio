### Insights:

## Product Category:

 <img src = "images/Product category by revenue.png">
	
•	The two best-selling product categories are Electronics and Grocery, and this fact cuts across the three customer segments (Regular, Premium and New). These two categories also have the highest number of transactions made. However, even though these two have a high purchase amount, we can see that there has been a steady decline and a downward trend in the number of customers interested in these products overtime. This is particularly true for Electronics as the downward trend in customers have also led to a downward trend in revenue.

## Rating:

•	Rating drives the revenue for this store  – The data shows that a lot more customers are willing to spend more on products with a 4-5 rating than a 1-2 rating. This tells us that the quality of our products matters a lot in describing our customers’ purchase behavior and an important revenue driver.

## Best Customer Profile :

 <img src = "images/Purchase by gender.png">

•	From the gender split our male customers represent 62% of the total transactions while females represent 38%
Also,  taking the customer age subset (18-30), (31-50), (51-70), it’s evident that males (18-30) made a total purchase of (496k), the highest of the  three age subsets, with the average best performing age subset of 23.

For females, the trend is the same, female customers (18-30) made a total purchase of 273k and 22 being average age. So, we can infer that our best customer profile would be overall Male between the ages of 18-30. 

## Recommendations:
•	Marketing should target more customers who are male and between the ages of 18-30  through targeted campaigns and promotional events as they are the most valuable in terms of driving revenue for the business.

•	Sales need to find innovative pitches and strategies to retain and recapture customers’ interests in our two best-selling product categories (especially Electronics) that has had a downward trend in the number of customers interested but still provides the highest margins in terms of revenue for the business.
	
•	Product needs to ensure that the quality of the product categories is between 4-5 (Excellent) as the data suggests this brings the highest profitability and customers are willing to spend more on quality products.

•	Product needs to find low-margin areas e.g. Cut costs of underperforming product categories like Clothing, Books and Home décor.
