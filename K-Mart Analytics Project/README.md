## Insights

### Product Category:

<img src = "images/Product category by revenue.png">

•	Decoratives, Furniture and Kitchenery are the top three product categories with the highest revenue. Consequentially, they are also the top three categories with the highest unit cost. At face value, we can draw inference that a product with a high unit cost will also generate a high revenue. Furthermore, a high unit cost can be theoretically attributed to a high-quality product, such we can deduce that a high-quality product will generate high revenue. 

### Product stocks Increase or decrease:

<img src = "images/Product stocks increase.png">

•	The Top 3 products that should be increased in stocks are Decoratives, Furniture and Kitchenery. Decoratives have had a total of 6,026 sales across all regions (the highest demand), followed by Furniture at 2927 and Kitchenery 2059. These three categories represent the products categories with the highest demand, and stocks of these three categories should be increased across all regions.

On the other hand, Lighting at 1292 product sales, Beddings at 821 and Sports 816 have the lowest demand across all regions and stocks of these can be reduced to improve profit margins. 


### Revenue:

•	Revenue is highly impacted and driven by the unit cost and unit price of a product category. The data describes a pattern between these three data points. The higher the unit cost, the higher the unit price and the higher the revenue. So, we can infer that a high unit cost means a high-quality product and correspondingly, people are willing to pay more for a quality product, hence a high unit price. This ultimately leads to high revenue and vice versa if the unit cost and price are low. 

### Salesperson deserving a promotion or demotion:

<img src = "images/Promoted salesrep.png">

To determine a Salesperson that deserves a promotion or demotion, the revenue generated by each salesperson will be considered. The top 3 salespeople with the highest revenue should be promoted and the bottom 3 should be demoted. The salespeople in the middle can be placed on a performance improvement plan. From the data, we can see that  Nicholas Cunningham, Donald Reynolds and Joe Price are the top three salespeople by revenue and should be promoted

while Jerry Green, Stephen Payne and Douglas Tucker are the bottom three salespeople and should be demoted.
 


### Recommendations:
•	Product needs to ensure that the quality of the product categories is top-notch by not undercutting on unit cost as the data suggests that products with a high unit cost and price generate the highest revenue and customers are willing to spend more on them.

•	Product needs to find low-margin areas e.g. Cut costs of underperforming product categories like Lighting, Beddings and Sports to increase profit.

•	It is important to keep a good stock of the product categories (Decoratives, Furniture and Kitchenery) that are in demand and reduce the stock of the ones (Lighting, Beddings and Sports) that aren’t to reduce costs incurred by the business across all four regions.	

•	Management needs to make some tough decisions in letting go or creating a performance improvement plan for the bottom 3 underperforming salespeople and  rewarding the top 3 best performing salespeople to promote competency within the business.
